## Prepare component for deployment

1) Update the version in the package.json file in the component's directory you want
to publish or create package.json file if it does not exist.


2) Check dependencies of the component.
If component use an external library, in most cases it should be added as peer dependency to the package.json file.
Otherwise, external library sources will be added to the component's source bundle.
In case the component use another component from the library, it works in the same way.

For example, if you use the Button inside your component
```shell script
import Button from '../Button';
```
and add ``"@stryberventures/gaia-react-native.button": ">=0.1.0"`` the ``Button`` source will not be
included to component's build

And vise versa, if the ``@stryberventures/gaia-react-native.button`` is not in the peer dependency list,
the source of the ``Button`` will be bundled with the component

Components names are based on ``export.config.json``

3) Add the component to ``export.config.json``

## Deploy the component to npm

1) Build the project

```shell script
yarn build
```

2) Navigate to the component's folder you want to publish, for example the Button

```shell script
cd build/Button
```

3) Publish the component

```shell script
npm publish --access public
```

To distribute multiple packages you can run the script which automatically deploys all packages, which versions were updated as well as new packages.

```shell script
npm run deploy
```

## Test the component before deployment
You can pack the component and install it locally to ensure that everything works as
expected. To do so, navigate to the component in the build directory
and run 'npm pack'

```shell script
cd build/Button
npm pack
```

It will create an .tgz archive, which you can copy to your project's root directory and
then install like:

```shell script
npm i ./stryberventures-gaia-react-native-ui-components-v2.button-0.0.1.tgz
```
